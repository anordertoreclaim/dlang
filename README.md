# dlang

This is a course project for Compilers Construction course taught during Fall 18' semester at Innopolis University. The code was written by me and a classmate of mine.
The code is an adaptation of the http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html handbook for D language, which is defined in the attached .pdf files.
